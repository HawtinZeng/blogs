After a long time, I reopened my survey project and wanted to go on develop some features, but I was prompted "node-gyp err" because of the script of canvas-node, then I tried many solutions on the net, and reset my computer, re-install nvm, but this node-gyp error still exists, Then I try to install python3.10 and Visual Studio 2022 community as the terminal prompted but still had errors thatÂ Missing input files, Then I checked canvas-node repo, install some dependencies according to the wiki of the repo, it worked!

_\* Find the problem module._

_\* Go through the docs of the module._

_\* Go through the error details in the terminal._

Then you will fix it!!!
