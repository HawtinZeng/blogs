Â Why: node-sass@4 isn't compatable with NodeV16, so I changed node-sass to V6, then I run nr dev:play, ERROR:node-sass...

  

I found this blog:https://blog.csdn.net/qq\_42389120/article/details/126544241, It says that we should use node v14...

  

After one-day's searching and trying, I tested all solutions in the Internet, no solutions worked, but I known that node-sass caused my problem , then I try to downgrade my Node version to V11(based on [node-sass README](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)) instead of upgrade node-sass(@4.11.0) to a higher one.
