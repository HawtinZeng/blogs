    Recently, I wonder what I can get by coding the FE project of DLZ in my vocations, nothing.

    I decide to develop a commercial game target on money and fun. Unity3D doesn't support JavaScript, but UnrealEngine does, so I will use UE as my primary game developing platform.

    Let's goooo!

    Why game? I can't find another direction which has lower cost and more useness based on my past experience.Maybe later I will find a more meaningful and hard direction.
